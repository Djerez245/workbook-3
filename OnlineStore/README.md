# Online Java Store
___
I have created an online store that you can view a list of available items that you can purchase.
on the home screen you have the option to select A) display all the available products, B) display your cart, 
or C) to leave the store.

### Display all products screen


On this screen you will be able to search an item by simply entering "1" and then you are prompted to enter the name
or SKU of the product you are interested in. and then you are asked if you would like to add the product to your cart by 
entering "Y" for yes or "N" for no. if select "2" you will be prompted to enter the name or SKU of the item that you would
like to add to your cart and once you enter the product it will instantly add it to your cart when you hit "enter" on your
keyboard.

### Shopping cart screen 

on the screen you will be able to view you're whole shopping cart. You can choose to remove an item if you so please.
you will also have the option to check out. if you select "1" you will be prompted with your total and then it will ask 
you how much you would like to pay. if you pay more than the total it will tell you how much change you will receive and 
it will print out your receipt in a file called "receipt.csv". if you do not enter enough money you will be prompted that 
you didn't pay enough money.
